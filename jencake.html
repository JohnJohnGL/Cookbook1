          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <h3>Cake:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 350 F. Spray the bottoms of three 8-inch round
              cake pans with non-stick baking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powders,
              espresso powder, baking powder and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separately, whisk together the eggs, milk, sour cream, oil and
              vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the dry ingredients to the wet and whisk for 10-15 seconds
              until well combined. If the batter doesn't seem dark enough, whisk
              in the black gel food coloring.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divide the batter between the cake pans. Bake the cakes on the
              center oven rack for about 25-27 minutes, until the tops spring
              back when gently touched, or a toothpick or cake tester inserted
              in the center comes out clean.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the pans on a cooling rack, cover loosely with a clean kitchen
              towel and cool completely.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Buttercream Frosting:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
              beat the butter for 1 minute until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separately, combine the powdered sugar, cocoa powders, meringue
              powder and salt. With the mixer on low, add the dry ingredients by
              spoonfuls, mixing until mostly combined. Add the vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whip the buttercream on medium speed (#4/6 on a Kitchen Aid mixer)
              for 4-5 minutes, scraping the bowl several times, until very light
              and fluffy. Add the milk only if needed for desired consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note: Black cocoa powder is more bitter than Dutch-processed cocoa
              powder. If the buttercream doesn't seem sweet enough to you, you
              can add 1/2-1 cup additional powdered sugar, but you'll need to
              add a small amount of milk, too, so the buttercream isn't too
              stiff.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Assembly:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Place one of the cooled cakes on a cake board or cake pedestal.
              Frost the cake with a layer of buttercream. Repeat stacking and
              filling the cake layers with buttercream, then frost all over with
              a thin crumb coat of buttercream. Chill the cake for 30 minutes in
              the refrigerator to set the crumb coat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Frost the cake all over with a final coat of buttercream. Before
              the frosting crusts over, scatter it with black sparkling sugar
              and sugar pearls. If desired, use any leftover buttercream to pipe
              swirls on top of the cake.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Notes:</h3>
          <p>
            If the buttercream doesn’t seem sweet enough, you can add 1/2-1 cup
            additional powdered sugar, but you’ll need to add a small amount of
            milk, too, so the buttercream isn’t too stiff. Keep the leftover
            cake in an airtight container or cake carrier at room temperature
            for up to 5 days.
